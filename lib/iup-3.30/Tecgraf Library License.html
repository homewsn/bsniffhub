<h2>Tecgraf Library License</h2>
<p>The Tecgraf products under this license are: <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup">
IUP</a>,
<a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd">CD</a> and <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im">
IM</a>.</p>

<p>All the products under this license are free software: they can be used for 
both academic and commercial purposes at absolutely no cost without affecting 
the license of the application. There are no 
paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions, either. Just 
download and use it. They are licensed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a> 
reproduced below, and so are compatible with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">
GPL</a> and also qualifies as
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html">Open Source</a> 
software. They are not in the public domain, 
<a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</a> keeps their copyright. The legal 
details are below.</p>
<p>The spirit of this license is that you are free to use the libraries for any 
purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is that if you 
do use them, then you should give us credit by including the copyright notice 
below somewhere in your product or its documentation. A nice, but optional, way 
to give us further credit is to include a Tecgraf logo and a link to our site in 
a web page for your product. </p>
<p>The libraries are designed, implemented and maintained by a team at 
Tecgraf/PUC-Rio in Brazil. The implementation is not derived from licensed 
software. The library was developed by request of Petrobras. Petrobras permits 
Tecgraf to distribute the library under the conditions here presented.</p>
<p>Some of the secondary libraries in IUP, CD and IM use third party libraries 
that have different license terms. Almost all third party libraries although 
different their licenses are compatible with this license and can be used for 
both academic and commercial purposes without affecting the license of the 
application. BUT some of these third party libraries are GPL based or not free 
for commercial applications. The respective IUP, CD and IM secondary libraries 
that use these restricted libraries follow their license terms, so are also 
restricted. These libraries are:</p>
<pre><strong>cdpdf</strong> + <strong>PDFLib</strong> (not free for commercial applications)
<strong>im_fftw</strong> + <strong>FFTW</strong> (GPL)</pre>
